## I have a question

You should not open issues for asking questions. There is many websites around,
that you probably know about, which are dedicated to discussions on particular
topics or even are purposed as Q&A searchable repositories.

Of course, popularity matters and for the time being you may obtain a response
from an opened issue, but we would be glad if you first tried towards these
beforementioned specialized channels.

## Code of conduct

This project and every of its contributions is governed by the [Code of
Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this
code (so better read it).
